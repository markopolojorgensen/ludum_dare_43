PulseAudio Jack shenanigans:
  set up jack sinks:
    # pactl load-module module-jack-sink client_name=pulse_sunvox_sink connect=no
    pactl load-module module-jack-sink client_name=pulse_obs_monitors_sink connect=no
    pactl load-module module-jack-sink client_name=pulse_desktop_sink connect=no
    pactl load-module module-jack-sink client_name=pulse_alerts_sink connect=no
    pactl list sinks
    pacmd set-default-sink whatever_number

  in pulse:
    route sunvox -> pulse_sunvox_sink
    route cmus -> pulse_desktop_sink
    route obs monitors -> pulse_obs_monitors_sink
    alerts are automatically routed to the default sink

  in Jack:
    pulse_obs_monitors_sink -> system
    pulse_sunvox_sink       -> system
    pulse_sunvox_sink  -> obs_jack_sunvox
    pulse_desktop_sink -> obs_jack_desktop
    pulse_alerts_sink  -> obs_jack_alerts

  in OBS:
    Mic
    obs_jack_sunvox side chained by obs_jack_alerts
    obs_jack_alerts side chained by obs_jack_alerts
